### My own paper!
- I was pretty busy this week getting this publication ready so that it was accepted to a workshop for an oral presentation (Participatory AI for Mental Health at NeurIPS 2022). It was relevant to NLP so I will place it here in this repo.
- We did work using speech as a biomarker for the diagnosis of depression and anxiety.
